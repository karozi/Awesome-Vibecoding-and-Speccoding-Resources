## What This Is

A collection of prompts used to operationalize prompt and file generation:

* [Prompt Builder](https://karozieminski.substack.com/p/the-self-improving-prompt-system) - a viral, reusable framework for building context-rich prompts.

* [The PRD Builder](https://karozieminski.substack.com/p/vibecoding-but-smarter-the-prd-prompt) - The PRD Prompt That Audits Itself For Hallucinations and Failure Modes

* [Prompt Evaluation Chain](https://karozieminski.substack.com/p/the-self-improving-prompt-system) - two-step system for prompt evaluation and refinement uses a 35-criteria rubric to score, critique, and improve prompts systematically. It’s designed as a project prompt, which makes it easily reusable (I use it for all my prompts)

* [The Ultimate Rules-For-AI Generator: A Beginner-Friendly System for Replit, Cursor, Gemini & Claude Builders](https://karozieminski.substack.com/p/vibecoding-rules-for-ai-generator-environment-aware-replit-cursor-lovable-gemini-antigravity) - This prompt is a complete, beginner-friendly system for generating rules for AI.
