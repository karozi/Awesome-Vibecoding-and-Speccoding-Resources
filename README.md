Welcome to the Awesome Vibecoding and Speccoding Resources repo—a living collection of checklists, guides, and practical tools for creators, product managers, and AI builders.
Whether you’re vibecoding, spec-driven, or just curious about rapid prototyping in the age of agentic workflows, you’ll find something useful here.

## Quick Start

* **Explore the checklists**: Each checklist is actionable and testable. Start with the README and branch out to `/resources`.
* **Join the community**: [Connect on Substack ↗](https://karozieminski.substack.com/)

## Terminology

* **Vibecoding**: Using natural language prompts to model, prototype, and build prototypes and products with the help of AI.

* **Speccoding**: Context-first vibecoding, a more structured approach to vibecoding, where context engineering, detailed rule sets, and product specs act as blueprints for AI, turning prompts into automatic, buildable features and processes.
